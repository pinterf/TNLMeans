// Very optimized memcpy() routine for all AMD Athlon and Duron family.
// This code uses any of FOUR different basic copy methods, depending
// on the transfer size.
// NOTE:  Since this code uses MOVNTQ (also known as "Non-Temporal MOV" or
// "Streaming Store"), and also uses the software prefetchnta instructions,
// be sure you're running on Athlon/Duron or other recent CPU before calling!
